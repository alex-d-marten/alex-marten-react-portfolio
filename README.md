# alex-marten-react-portfolio

## Description
This repository contains the code necessary to host a React Portfolio for myself, Alex Marten. I have also used MDB Bootstrap to aid in the designing of the webpage and I have deployed the website to GitHub Pages. This website is still a work in progress and back-end functionality is going to be added in the future. For any recommendations please contact me!
